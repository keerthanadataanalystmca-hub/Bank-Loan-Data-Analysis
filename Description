üè¶ Bank Loan Data Analysis Mini Project: Assessing Risk and Portfolio Health
This project is a hands-on Data Analysis mini-project focused on exploring and analyzing a Bank Loan dataset. The primary objective is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculate crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and create a series of visualizations to help a financial institution assess lending risk, understand borrower profiles, and monitor the overall health of its loan portfolio.

‚ú® Key Features and Analysis
The analysis is driven by a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) and focuses on two major areas: portfolio performance metrics and detailed risk segmentation.

1. Core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project calculates and tracks essential metrics for a snapshot of the lending activity:

Total Loan Applications: The absolute count of all loan requests.

Total Funded Amount: The total capital disbursed as loans.

Total Amount Received: The total amount collected back from borrowers (principal + interest).

Average Interest Rate: The portfolio's average cost of borrowing.

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: A critical measure of the average financial health of the borrowers.

2. Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Segmentation
A core part of the analysis involves segmenting the loans to identify risk:

Category	Description (Likely loan_status)	Metrics Calculated
Good Loan	Loans that are 'Fully Paid' or 'Current'.	Application Count, Funded Amount, Total Received Amount, Percentage of Total Applications.
Bad Loan	Loans that are 'Charged Off' (Defaulted).	Application Count, Funded Amount, Total Received Amount, Percentage of Total Applications.

3. Comprehensive Visual Trend Analysis
The project includes a suite of charts to visualize lending patterns across various dimensions:

Visualization	Purpose
Monthly Trends	Identifying seasonality and long-term changes in loan issuance and repayment.
Regional Analysis by State	Pinpointing key lending geographies and regional disparities in loan performance.
Loan Term Analysis	Understanding the distribution of loans across 36-month and 60-month terms.
Employee Length Analysis	Assessing the impact of a borrower's employment history on lending metrics.
Loan Purpose Breakdown	Visualizing how metrics are distributed across various loan reasons (e.g., debt consolidation, house, car).
Home Ownership Analysis	Hierarchical view (e.g., Tree Map) showing how home ownership status (RENT, MORTGAGE, OWN) correlates with loan metrics.
